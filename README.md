## Intro
Because of too much unwanted pulls to original Ansible contrib/inventory/ec2.py, created fork. Here you can push new features and style fixes.

## ToDo
* Add groups by state;
* short info about tag_destination_variable;
* List of tags in tag_destination_variable;

## P.S.
I'm not Python/Ansible developer, just a system administrator.
